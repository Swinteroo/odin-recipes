            <li>4 cups (500g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup (240ml) warm milk (110°F/43°C)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup (75g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 1/4 tsp (1 packet) active dry yeast</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tsp of salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Filling:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup (200g) packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tbsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp ground nutmeg (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Cream Cheese Frosting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 oz (115g) cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (60g) unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (180g) powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Dough</strong> - In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm milk and let it sit for about 5 minutes until foamy. Add sugar, melted butter, eggs, and salt. Gradually add the flour and mix until a soft dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li><strong>First Rise</strong> - Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the Filling</strong> - In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Once the dough has risen, roll it out on a floured surface into a 16x12 inch rectangle. Spread the softened butter evenly over the dough, then sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mixture generously on top.</li>
            <li><strong>Roll and Cut</strong> - Starting from the long side, tightly roll up the dough into a log and pinch the seam to seal. Cut the roll into 12 even slices and place them in a greased 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
            <li><strong>Second Rise</strong> - Cover the rolls with a damp cloth and let them rise for another 30-45 minutes until they’ve puffed up.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake</strong> - Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake the rolls for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Let them cool slightly while you prepare the frosting.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the Cream Cheese Frosting</strong> - In a medium bowl, beat together the cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt until smooth and creamy. Spread the frosting generously over the warm rolls, letting it melt into every swirl.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>BiteCraft Bits</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>To help your dough rise faster, place it in a slightly warm (but turned-off) oven or microwave with a cup of hot water beside it.</li>
            <li>You can refrigerate the cut rolls overnight. In the morning, let them come to room temperature for about 30 minutes before baking.</li>
            <li>Drizzle a little heavy cream over the rolls just before baking for an extra tender and gooey texture.</li>
        </ul>
